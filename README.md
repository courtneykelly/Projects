Getting familiar with AWS Lambda and many other AWS Services, such as API Gateway, S3, IAML, EC2, etc. Created several functions, to see what services could be be put behind Lambda in order to scale.

python code to parse an RSS feed (i.e. the US-Cert security advisory feed) and run a regex (i.e. search for 'cisco') and push to Slack (i.e. #security). 

## Slack API
Exploring the Slack API with python Slack Client by sending messages to a specified user in `message.py` and consuming a channel with `consume.py` #trolling. Also explored the Real Time Messaging API to create and integrate a slack bot named George.

scrapy code that reliabily grabs a list of urls, runs them through python newspaper, and outputs the data to json. Fully supports utf-8 and also outputs a list of urls it failed to fetch and why it failed.

## Crypto-currency transaction database
Set up Abe (https://github.com/bitcoin-abe/bitcoin-abe) or similar to start logging transactions into a database for BitCoin. Do this for as many currencies as possible. Fine if also logs to disk via json. Make the process repeatable.
