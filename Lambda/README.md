# AWS Lambda

Getting familiar with AWS Lambda and many other AWS Services, such as API Gateway, S3, IAML, EC2, etc. Here are several lambda functions I created using AWS Services.

	* Get IP: returns public IP address

	* Names API: two functions, does stuff with names

	* Parse HTML: takes url string, and parses HTML content, returns json object

	* Lambda Limits: pushes the AWS Lambda limit of 50 MB for a given deployment package, using the [Zappa tool](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa).
